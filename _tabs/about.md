Hello! I'm Jacrorious, but if you're reading this you can call me Jay! I'm currently working as an IT Security Engineer at [Ada County](https://adacounty.id.gov/).

My cybersecurity journey began at Boise State University's [Institute of Pervasive Cybersecurity](https://www.boisestate.edu/cybersecurity/), where I served as an analyst. The Institute is at the forefront of cybersecurity research and innovation in Idaho and the region, fostering partnerships between industry, academia, and government to enhance national cybersecurity capabilities. This experience laid the foundation for my career, leading to my role as a Cyber Security Intern at [St. Luke's](https://www.stlukesonline.org/), Idaho's largest health system, before stepping into my current position.


I hold a Bachelor's degree in Cyber Operations and Resilience from Boise State University. You can read more about my academic journey [here](https://www.boisestate.edu/online/2024/01/14/jacorious-smith-from-air-force-to-cybersecurity-expert/), where I was featured in a student success story.

When I'm not geeking out about cyber things, you'll find me immersed in various hobbies. I love watching anime and movies, I consider myself a LEGO builder, and enjoy bringing ideas to life through 3D printing. I also maintain an active lifestyle through outdoor activities and regular exercise.

I'm passionate about exploring the world and have already visited three fascinating countries, Tanzania, Qatar, and Germany. This is just the beginning of my travel adventures, and I look forward to adding more destinations to my list!

Feel free to connect with me to discuss cybersecurity, share anime recommendations, or exchange travel stories!
